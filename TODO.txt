- Add descriptor set data updates to an actual Vulkan buffers
	( Shape.cpp )

- Add descriptor set allocation for pipelines
	( DeviceResource_GraphicsPipeline.cpp )

- Add uniform buffer objects for pipelines
	( DeviceResource_GraphicsPipeline.cpp )

- Create an API that allows easier command buffer recording on initialization stage of the scene node

- Enable actually drawing something
	- Add proper values to the Vulkan render pass object
	- Add rendering into G-buffers
	- Add render pass from G-buffers to final render
	- Pass final image to swapchain

- Review scene hierarchy
	- A scene depends on SceneBase, this is a lot of extras for scene to include so review what exactly is needed in a scene from SceneBase
	- Rename SceneBase to a SceneCommon instead and move most of the old SceneBase functionality into SceneNode
	( SceneBase.h/cpp, SceneNode.h/cpp, <create file for SceneHierarchy class> )
